# File Update Algorithm in Python

## Project Overview
In this project, I created an algorithm using Python that updates a list of allowed IP addresses in a healthcare company's security system. The algorithm checks whether any IP addresses in the "remove list" are in the "allow list" and removes them accordingly.

## Steps Followed
1. Opened the `allow_list.txt` file.
2. Read its contents and converted them into a list.
3. Iterated through the remove list to identify IP addresses that should be removed.
4. Removed those IP addresses from the allow list.
5. Saved the updated list back into the file.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- File Handling
