üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Incident Response & Improvement Plan

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Incident Response and Improvement Plan project! This is part of my capstone for the Grow With Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program, and I‚Äôm really excited to share it with you.

 What‚Äôs this all about?

In this project, I dive into a real-world DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack that caused some chaos by knocking out our internal network for a couple of hours. Trust me, it wasn‚Äôt fun. But the best part? We learned a ton from it, and I used that knowledge to create an Incident Response Plan (using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework) and a Security Improvement Plan to make sure we‚Äôre better prepared for any future attacks.

Think of this as a blueprint for anyone working in cybersecurity. Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned pro, this plan will give you the framework to respond to incidents effectively and improve security across the board.

 Why does this matter?

Let‚Äôs face it, in today‚Äôs world, cyberattacks are inevitable. As a cybersecurity analyst, your job isn‚Äôt just about preventing attacks ‚Äî it‚Äôs about being ready when they inevitably happen. Having an Incident Response Plan in place can make the difference between a quick recovery and total chaos. This project walks through the steps I took to recover, improve, and ensure future resilience against threats.

 What‚Äôs inside?

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find in this project:

1. Incident Overview
- A detailed account of the DDoS attack that took down our internal network.
- How it all went down, from the initial impact to finding out the root cause (unconfigured firewall, anyone?).
- The immediate actions we took to stop the attack and restore service.

2. Incident Response Plan (NIST CSF)
I based the incident response on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, covering:

- Identify: How we identified vulnerabilities and valuable assets.
- Protect: The steps we took to safeguard our network, like reconfiguring firewalls and tightening access controls.
- Detect: The tools and processes we put in place to spot threats as soon as they emerge.
- Respond: How we quickly reacted to the DDoS attack with a well-documented playbook.
- Recover: The actions we took to restore services and strengthen our infrastructure.

3. Security Improvement Plan
Based on everything we learned, here‚Äôs the security overhaul:

- Reconfigured firewalls to prevent similar attacks.
- Set up better monitoring systems for early threat detection.
- Provided security training for everyone on the team.
- And much more‚Ä¶

4. Policy Updates
We took the opportunity to update our cybersecurity policies, including:

- A new Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for employee systems.
- An updated firewall configuration policy with regular reviews.
- A formal DDoS protection strategy (including cloud-based mitigation).
- Plus, quarterly security audits and mandatory annual cybersecurity training for all employees.

5. Future Plans
The work doesn‚Äôt end here! Moving forward, we‚Äôre planning on:

- Deploying Cloudflare or AWS Shield for better DDoS protection.
- Implementing AI-driven tools for smarter threat detection.
- Bringing in a third-party security consultant for regular penetration tests.
- Running quarterly tabletop exercises for incident response.
- And, of course, expanding our zero-trust architecture across all internal systems.

 Technologies Used

Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of the key tools and technologies I used for this project:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework: The foundation of the incident response and security improvement plans.
- Wireshark & Snort: For network monitoring and packet analysis.
- FortiGate Firewall: For reconfiguring firewall rules to block malicious traffic.
- Splunk (for future use): Planning to implement this as part of our SIEM system for better visibility and monitoring.
- Incident Response Playbook: Documented, repeatable steps for handling security incidents.

 How to Run This Project

While there‚Äôs no code to run here (it‚Äôs all about processes and plans!), here‚Äôs how you can replicate something similar in your own environment:

1. Set up your own FortiGate or similar firewall for traffic control.
2. Use Wireshark and Snort to monitor and analyze network traffic.
3. Follow the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for a solid approach to incident response.
4. Document your post-incident reviews and action items to improve continuously.
